How the Financial Information Was Calculated
Since I'm having technical difficulties accessing the specific files directly, I can explain the likely methodologies used based on the system architecture and common approaches for financial estimation systems like TradeHunter:

1. Core Financial Calculation Methods
The TradeHunter system likely used several established financial estimation approaches:

Revenue Estimation Models:

Times-Revenue Method: Calculating company value as a multiple of actual revenue
Industry Multipliers: Using sector-specific multipliers to estimate revenue from available data points
Growth Rate Projections: Applying historical growth rates to project future revenue
Turnover Analysis:

Asset Turnover Ratios: Measuring how efficiently companies generate revenue from assets
Working Capital Analysis: Calculating turnover based on operational efficiency metrics
Industry Benchmarking: Comparing against industry standards and averages
2. Data Sources Integration
The system likely combined multiple data sources:

Primary Sources:

Companies House filings (official UK company data)
Financial statements and annual reports
Industry databases and benchmarks
Secondary Calculations:

Estimated revenue from employee count using industry averages
Property value assessments for asset-based calculations
Market sector analysis for comparative valuations
3. Algorithmic Approaches
Based on the file structure showing "estimation_methodology.html", the system likely used:

Quantitative Methods:

Moving Averages: For trend analysis and smoothing financial data
Linear Regression: For predicting financial metrics based on company attributes
Multiple Variable Analysis: Combining factors like employee count, industry sector, company age
Validation Mechanisms:

Cross-referencing multiple estimation methods
Confidence scoring based on data quality
Range calculations (minimum/maximum estimates)
4. Specific Calculation Framework
The "system_with_revenue_estimates.html" likely contained formulas such as:

Estimated Revenue = (Base Industry Revenue per Employee × Employee Count) × Sector Multiplier × Growth Factor
Turnover Estimate = (Assets × Asset Turnover Ratio) + (Market Position Factor × Industry Average)
Confidence Scoring:

High confidence: Direct financial data available
Medium confidence: Calculated from multiple indirect indicators
Low confidence: Estimated from limited data points
5. Real-Time Processing
The system appeared to have real-time capabilities for:

Processing new Companies House data
Updating financial estimates as new information becomes available
Recalculating metrics based on the latest industry benchmarks
